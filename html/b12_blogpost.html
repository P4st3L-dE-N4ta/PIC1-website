                    As we get closer and closer to the project’s deadline, we keep on working, as
                    there is still a lot to be done. For now, we are finishing everything related to the
                    final prototype, still making some adjustments, looking for better material and
                    wiring everything up.

                    <h3>Hardware adjustments </h3>
                    <p>
                        We started the week by searching more material to work with - namely, we
                        searched for a couple of  OpAmps and some more LEDs. But why more OpAmps? Well, first
                        of all, we want to increase the frequency of the modulated signal, which has
                        become quite a limiting factor with the models we have been using; other than this,
                        we’re also looking for a better current bias. And what have these upgrades allowed
                        us to do? Well, although it may not seem like much, the answer to the question is
                        as simple as: the signal clarity and definition improved greatly.

                <div class="section2 section">
                    <h3> Wiring the prototype </h3>
                    <p>
                        After the final decisions about the components were made, what was then left
                        to do was to wire up the circuit on a stripboard and run some tests to check if
                        everything was alright and if, as we expected, the performance improved. And it did!
                        There is a really big difference between working with a simple breadboard and an
                        actual stripboard meant for prototypes, the signal’s clarity and performance improved
                        greatly, so we are satisfied with that!
                    </p>

                <p>
                    It looks like the hardware part of the project is now officially completed,
                    which comes with a very pleasant feeling of relief, above all else. For the next
                    (and FINAL) week of work, all that’s essentially left to do is finish the software
                    part responsible for “translating” the information to and from a binary stream of
                    data in order to actually transmit media through the prototype, and not just a LED
                    beam. Other than this, we will also have to test the operation of the circuit
                    through water, which is actually the final objective of this whole thing!
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, basically, there’s only one week left, and we are very excited to finish
                    our project and see the cumulus of our work. That’s about it, bye!
