                <h2> Summary </h2>
                <p>
                     This week was quite busy, actually! Well, for one, we met in person to work
                    on the prototype for the first time, given the late arrival of the material and
                    the fact that we all don’t really live close to each other. On the other hand, on
                    that same meeting, we ran into some obstacles and decided to contact a former
                    electronics professor of ours, who kindly accepted our request for help and gave us some
                    incredibly useful advice. After receiving some very helpful advice, some of us got
                    together again during the rest of the week to implement the suggested changes. Quite a
                    wild week!
                </p>

                    <h3> Meeting in Afonso’s basement </h3>
                    <p>
                        With the expression “We got together in Afonso’s basement!”, we meant that we
                        all went to Afonso’s house to work on the prototype. However, we immediately ran
                        into some problems with the circuit. Having already appropriately set up the
                        transmission part of the device, it so happened that the light emitted by the LED wasn’t
                        strong enough to be recognized by the receiver - this is alarming because the
                        detection of the signal is practically everything about the project! The signal wasn’t
                        detected with neither the green nor the blue LED, but was quite sensitive with the
                        ambient light.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       We ended up trying several different circuits, but, to no avail, didn’t
                        progress much. So, we decided to contact a former professor of ours, specialized in
                        electronics.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section2 section">
                    <h3> Help from a professor </h3>
                    <p>
                        After emailing the professor, we met in their office. After quickly briefing
                        them about our ideas and the difficulties we were having, the teacher immediately
                        started asking us questions and giving advice.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        First of all, they advised us not on the circuit, but on the way we are
                        sending the signal - as a quick way of reminding the reader, we were sending the
                        signal through a carrier signal modulated with NRZ-OOK. Their suggestions were
                        increasing the frequency of the carrier signal, as well as advising us to reconsider the
                        selected code.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, about our difficulty in regards to the hardware part, a lot of
                        adjustments were made. About the emitting LED, it simply wasn’t strong enough to be
                        detected, so we were told that we needed to use larger ones, which we already have at
                        our disposal - either that, or we could alternatively resort to phototransistors,
                        which is a path we don’t really want to pursue. Beyond this change, the biggest
                        contribution we got from the meeting was about how to connect everything to the circuit
                        entry, how to assemble all of the different parts and how to layout the different
                        amplifier stages. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The meeting was conducted by the whole team.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section3 section">
                    <h3> Even more progress </h3>
                    <p>
                        As was said, the team met again on the weekend to keep working on the
                        prototype. For now, having already designed the circuit we intend on using, we are still
                        testing the circuits in different ways, in order to uncover some equipment limitations
                        and so on. Our big idea consists in amplifying the signal to, then, send it
                        through a comparator to obtain the modulated message waveform, perfectly straight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We start by amplifying the signal with a TIA (Trans-Impedance Amplifier),
                        followed by a buffer. Then, we enter the signal treatment phase, where the buffer’s
                        output signal is divided between one that goes straight to the positive input of a
                        comparator and another one that goes through an active peak detector followed by a
                        resistive divider, towards the negative input of the comparator. This device, which is
                        not really a comparator, but an OpAmp (we don’t really need a comparator because
                        we are sticking with low voltages and we needn’t worry about the slew-rate), ends
                        up “drawing” a perfectly rectangular wave, to serve as the modulated message.
                        Another thing worth mentioning is that the peak detector (envelope filter), comprised
                        of an OpAmp with positive feedback, a diode, a capacitor and a (large) resistor,
                        is set up this way, i.e., is active, in order to avoid a hefty voltage drop due
                        to the diode, and keep the output as “clean” as possible.

                <p>
                    This was quite a busy week, but we did manage to progress a lot, much thanks
                    to the advice we got in our meeting with the professor. The next couple of weeks
                    seem quite exciting, so stay tuned. Bye!
