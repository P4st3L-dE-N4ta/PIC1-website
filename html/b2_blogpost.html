                <p>
                    Hi! This week, we carried on with our progress in the software 
                    department, with our main objectives for now being improving the 
                    transmission rate of the transmitter device. In addition to this, 
                    we also had a meeting with an expert in digital communication. 
                    Given that we are currently still developing and working around 
                    some issues in the software department, this opportunity proved 
                    itself worthwhile, especially in this relatively early stage in the project.

                    <h3> Meeting </h3>
                    <p>
                        On Friday the 28th of February, we met with an investigador specialized in digital communication, 
                        The interviewee is affiliated with a renowned institution at a national and European level in the 
                        field of telecommunications. Some of the several expertise topics studied by the research group 
                        this investigator belongs to consist of Signal Processing for Wireless Communications, Modulation 
                        and Coding Theory, and Wireless Networks, areas which fall right under our interest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our main questions were centered around error detection and correction. Although our goal is real-time 
                        communication, we are still debating the possibility of using pre-recorded messages, which justifies 
                        studying error correction. Firstly, we asked which error correction code would be best suited in the 
                        context of our project - the interviewee suggested using a Hamming(7,4) code. The way this algorithm 
                        functions is that it adds three parity bits to a 4-bit word, turning it into a 7 bit one. The value 
                        of the parity bits are a result of XOR combinations between the bits of the original word, and they 
                        are calculated at both the transmitter and the receiver ends, so that if mismatches occur, the 
                        pattern of the parity bits indicates the position of the erroneous bit, whose value is then corrected. 
                        This procedure implies that the algorithm can either detect and correct one bit error or detect two 
                        errors, and although it adds redundancy, it is efficient for small data blocks, as is the case.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, our prototype will be unidirectional, which then raised the following question: what to do 
                        about inevitable data errors? Well, the interviewee suggested two techniques, one with the purpose of 
                        correcting burst noise (a sudden disturbance that affects several consecutive bits) and the other one 
                        with the intent of correcting random errors. Instead of transmitting bits in their original order, the 
                        first technique, called Interleaving, rearranges them so that consecutive bits in the data stream are 
                        physically separated in the transmitted signal. The advantages of this method reside in the fact that 
                        now, burst errors are converted into isolated single-bit errors, which are easier to correct.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second technique is based on the use of a Convolutional Encoder, which is a type of forward error 
                        correction (FEC) that adds redundancy to the data stream in a structured way, being particularly effective 
                        for correcting random errors. With this method, the input data bits are processed by the encoder through a 
                        series of shift registers and XOR operations so that, for each input bit, a couple more arise - it is 
                        created a codeword with the use of redundancy. This is also a memory-based encoding, meaning that the 
                        output bits depend on the previous input bits.

                <p>
                    This interview proved itself to be one of the most important ones we had so far, because of the knowledge 
                    and ideas we gained and will now look to embed into our project. We consider ourselves lucky to have had 
                    the opportunity of chatting with an expert renowned in the matter, to whom we send our thanks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This interview was conducted by team members Ricardo Rodrigues, Afonso Frazão, Mauro Cordeiro e André Salvaterra.
