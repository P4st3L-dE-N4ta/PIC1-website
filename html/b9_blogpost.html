                <p>
                    Hello again! This week proved itself to be slightly bittersweet for us. On the
                    one hand, we still haven’t received the materials we ordered even though we
                    ordered them quite a while ago, which is setting us a tiny bit back every single day,
                    but we still managed to progress on the hardware department using some electronics
                    material owned by Afonso.   Even though we’re not working under ideal conditions, we
                    still try to find ways to work around the unfortunate circumstances.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="sections">
                <div class="section1 section">
                    <h3> Hardware and software progress </h3>
                    <p>
                        While working on the prototype during the week, we started by writing an
                        Arduino program capable of calculating the BER of a snippet from a random binary
                        transmission. This algorithm may also help us to later be able to distinguish between each
                        type of error (either random errors or, for instance, burst errors, etc.), and to
                        hopefully be able to apply different types of ECC’s to each type of error.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, there was also quite a big leap on the hardware department. Using an
                        LM741CN OpAmp, we managed to improve the IV receptor, going from having a BER value of
                        0 at a distance of 5 cm to having that same value at 70 cm, which is a 1400%
                        increase in efficacy! And even with these 70 cm we still have a very low SNR value,
                        which makes us believe that we might be able to amplify the signal even more without
                        sacrificing its quality. The future seems bright!   

                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="section2 section">
                    <h3> Weekly meeting with our coordinators </h3>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, on Friday we had the usual meeting with our project coordinators. Even
                        though this is merely a routine project check-up, we did discuss some important
                        matters about the ElectroDay presentation and some other matters.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the presentation will in reality be a sampling of the prototype in an
                        already small (and quite conditioned) environment, it means that we are allowed to cut
                        some corners. And well, given that the implementation of the interleaving algorithm
                        is proving itself to be more complicated than we originally anticipated, our
                        counselling professors advised us “not to get lost in things that aren’t totally
                        necessary”, which means that we are contemplating not doing the interleaving part.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        About the presentation itself, we are planning on demoing the prototype in a
                        small see-through water tank and having different types of messages (audio, video,
                        pictures, etc.) being transmitted in a way that can make it possible for the attendees
                        to hear and/or see the process in real time, either through a speaker or a
                        screen.
                    </p>

                <h2> Conclusion </h2>
                <p>
                    Another week goes by and we still haven’t received the materials we ordered.
                    If another week passes, we might start to get a bit preoccupied. But for now, we
                    remain optimistic and try to progress through our own means. So, see ya next week!
