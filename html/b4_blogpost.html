                <p>
                    Hi, everyone! Here we are back at it again. Unfortunately, this week we
                    weren’t extremely productive in the software department, and the fact that we are
                    still working on choosing equipment ends up limiting the hardware side of things. We
                    also didn’t have any meeting or interview with anyone.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="sections">
                <div class="section1 section">
                    <h3> Software Progress </h3>
                    <p>
                        Even though we didn’t make much progress since last week, we still managed to
                        work and make an effort to study all of the information and ideas that were
                        proposed to us during previous meetings. After all, even though all of it was extremely
                        valuable, there’s still the need for some effort, not only in learning about the matter
                        in question, but also in thinking about ways in which to apply it to our future
                        prototype. Having already had success in the actual communication part, our next goal is
                        centered around error correction (which we are currently studying), but in order to
                        actually detect and correct errors, we need to have them in the messages, which need to
                        actually be big enough to allow errors to happen.
                    </p>

                    <h3> Hardware Pick </h3>
                    <p>
                        Beyond working on actually understanding and organizing all of the information
                        that we have, we also made a provisional list of the components we intend on using:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>MTE5052M3A-UBG emitter;</li>
                        <li>MTD5052W receiver;</li>
                        <li>CMC-2742WBL-25L microphones;</li>
                        <li>Breadboard and cables, both probably available in Técnico;</li>
                        <li>Possible microcontroller, we already have one Raspberry Pi Pico, but may need a more powerful 
                            option - our current alternative is the Teensy 4.1 board.</li>

                    Unfortunately, it was a slow week, made even slower by evaluations on other
                    classes, but we’ll surely do more next week. Thanks for reading, and see you all next
                    week!
