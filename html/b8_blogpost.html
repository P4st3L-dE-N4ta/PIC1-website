                <h2> Summary </h2>
                <p>
                    This week marked the start of the 4th term of the year, and with it the return
                    to normal school activity. Even though we still haven’t received the material we
                    ordered a while back, over the course of this week we progressed even further in the
                    software department and started doing some much needed simulations, all the while
                    “surviving” a nation-wide blackout.

                    <h3> Software Development </h3>
                    <p>
                        As we predicted in the latest post, this week we continued last week’s work on
                        the software part of the prototype, developing our own implementation of some
                        ECC’s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our first achievement of the week was writing the C code for the Hamming(7,4)
                        algorithm relative to the project, which is an ECC we talked about quite a long time
                        ago. To put it in short, the Hamming(7,4) is an algorithm that adds three
                        additional check bits to every 4 bits of data, which allows it do either detect and
                        correct one wrong bit of information or to detect two wrong bit values.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The next step in the software development is writing the interleaving part of the code.
                    </p>

                <div class="section2 section">
                    <h3> Work on the simulations </h3>
                    <p>
                        Added to the progress in the software part of the project, we also started
                        doing some simulations, which is something we wrongfully downplayed at the start of
                        the project, to be honest.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        So far, our simulations (done in MATLAB) have consisted of basically
                        generating signals through square waves and then obtaining the equivalent modulated
                        message with OOK-NRZ, while also adding Gaussian White Noise to the signal to simulate
                        the noise expected to be found when testing the prototype. With these simple
                        simulations, our objective is to calculate the SNR from the noise channel in order to then
                        obtain the BER value of the modulated message signal. In the near future, we will
                        start adjusting and tweaking the noise channel to more adequately represent the
                        obstacles the prototype will eventually face underwater.

                <p>
                    Now that we are back to the usual ordeals, we are beginning to pick up the
                    pace again and look forward to actually do the more hands-on part of the project
                    (from the moment when the materials eventually arrive…). We have several tasks on
                    our minds and will keep going at it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, bye, and see you all next week!
