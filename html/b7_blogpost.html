                <p>
                    After going through an exhausting exam season, we resumed working on our
                    project, making palpable advancements in the software department.

                    <h3> Justification for the big time gap between posts </h3>
                    <p>
                        First of all, we have to address an issue which even though is relatively
                        minor in comparison to the big picture of this project as a whole, still is somewhat
                        undesirable - the inconsistency between blog posts. During the last couple of weeks of the
                        3rd term (and the exam weeks as well), evaluations came piling up and each one of
                        us had to put this project on hold while we studied for other courses. Now, here
                        we are again, and it seems that in the following weeks we will be more dedicated
                        to this project, even more so because we are about to enter the most exciting
                        part of the project, which is the assembly and tests phases of our prototype!

                    <h3> Software progress </h3>
                    <p>
                        So, this post’s big event is the progress made in respect to the software part
                        of the prototype. On the beginning of this semester, our focus remained purely on
                        transmitting information and then building from there, increasing the transmission rate and
                        so on. Now, we’ve began working on the 2nd (big) half of this component and so
                        far, the software team has developed the C code relative to the compression and
                        decompression of data. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our implementation was based on the LZW (Lempel-Ziv-Welch) algorithm, which is
                        a lossless data compression algorithm going back to the 80s. In its simplest
                        version, the algorithm encodes sequences of 8-bit data as fixed-length 12-bit codes,
                        where the codes from 0 to 255 represent 1-character sequences consisting of the
                        corresponding 8-bit character and the codes 256 through 4095 are created in a dictionary for
                        sequences encountered in the data as it is encoded. At each stage in compression, input
                        bytes are gathered into a sequence until the next character would make a sequence
                        with no code yet in the dictionary. The code for the sequence (without that
                        character) is added to the output, and a new code (for the sequence with that character)
                        is added to the dictionary.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our next focus is about taking care of the error correction and detection
                        part, which we predict will be completely finished by the end of next week.

                <p>
                    To be frank, we may not have made much progress this week, but we still worked
                    on something nonetheless. We hope to receive the material we ordered as soon as
                    possible in order to immediately assemble the prototype while all the evaluations
                    relative to the classes that will be starting next week still haven’t showed up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are glad to be back. See ya next week!
